# Hello world on GCP App Server

This example was used on my [post](https://dev.to/odilonjk/seu-primeiro-servico-go-na-google-cloud-app-engine-310a).

To use it, you just need to create your project on GCP App Engine and deploy this code (on Cloud Shell or GCP SDK) with the command: `gcloud app deploy`.
